## Light Proxy Events

If any of the registered variables change value an event is fired. However, those events are generated by the VariableManager. The Light Proxy doesn't concern itself with those.

1. An event is fired when the light level changes. This fires an event with number 5000.

2. An event is fired when something happens to one of the buttons on the device. The pattern for determining the event number is:Â  5001 + action + (`btnID * 5`).

The actions are

- Release = 0
- Push = 1
- Single Click = 2
- Double Click = 3
- Triple Click = 4


The button IDs are determined by the protocol driver, but the standard ordering is:

Top = 0

Bottom = 1

Toggle = 2
