## MIN ON

Used to inform the proxy that the hardware minimum On level has changed.  This is useful for hardware such as Control4â€™s Gen3 lighting where the hardware supports remapping where 1% brightness is when the light is on.  This does not change the available brightness percent range from 0-100%.  Note that with LED lights, the  usable minimum on range does change depending on bulb, age of bulb and other factors.
