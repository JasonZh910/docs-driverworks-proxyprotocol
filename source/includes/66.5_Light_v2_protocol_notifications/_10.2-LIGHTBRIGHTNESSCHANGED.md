## LIGHT BRIGHTNESS CHANGED

Used to notify the proxy that a lights brightness changed.  It is not required to send a LIGHT\_BRIGHTNESS\_CHANGING Notify before sending this, so devices like switches or some dimmers that do not provide status on where they are going can still be implemented with the new API. This notify should always be sent to the proxy when the driver starts and/or when the hardware comes online and the driver knows the actual brightness of the hardware.
