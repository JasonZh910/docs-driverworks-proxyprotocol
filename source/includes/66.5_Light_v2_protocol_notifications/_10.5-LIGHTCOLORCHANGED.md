## LIGHT COLOR CHANGED

Used to inform the proxy that the color has finished changing.  It is possible to use this call without the LIGHT\_COLOR\_CHANGING Notify call being sent first but, some Composer Programming paths will not be run.  This notify should always be sent to the proxy when the driver starts and/or when the hardware comes online and the driver knows the actual color of the hardware.
