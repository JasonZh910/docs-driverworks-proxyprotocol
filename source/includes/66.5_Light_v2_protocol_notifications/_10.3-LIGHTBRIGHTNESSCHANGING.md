## LIGHT BRIGHTNESS CHANGING

Used to notify the Light proxy that a light’s brightness is changing. The benefit of using this Notify is that drivers can provide data on how the light brightness is changing. Using this Notify greatly improves interaction with the system in numerous ways for components such as Advanced Lighting Scene Agent, Navigators and Composer Programming.  A driver should enabled the supports\_target capability if using this notify.  Note the LIGHT\_LEVEL notify should be avoided if a driver uses this API.

Behaviorally, the Light proxy generates percentage scaling for UI's and other system components. However, since a single percent may not be enough light resolution, programming and other system components can set raw values for a device.  

In the case where the end of the ramping value is unknown, specifying the end point of where the device will change to (if no further interaction is done) is the best practice.  For example, is if someone holds a button to slow-ramp a light On, the driver should Notify the proxy that the end point is 100 if 100 is the max value of the light.


### Signature

`LIGHT_BRIGHTNESS_CHANGING ()`


| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| value | LIGHT\_BRIGHTNESS\_CURRENT: Double. Raw value of the lighting level. Does not need to be 0-100% and can be based on the Min and Max Brightness capabilities such as 0-10, 0-99. 0-256 and even negative if the Brightness Min is defined as a negative number. |
| value | LIGHT\_BRIGHTNESS\_TARGET: Double. Raw value of where the light is going to. |
| int | RATE: Number of milliseconds it will take to ramp to the target level. |


### Returns

`None`


### Usage Note

Dimmer Drivers should only use BRIGHTNESS\_CHANGING and BRIGHTNESS\_CHANGED notifies and no longer use LEVEL\_CHANGE notify.

Switch drivers only need to use the BRIGHTNESS\_CHANGED notify.
