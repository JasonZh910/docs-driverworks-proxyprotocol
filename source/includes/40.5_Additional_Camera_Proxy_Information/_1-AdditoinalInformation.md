# Additional Camera Proxy Information

### User Interfaces

The Installer may need to adjust camera configuration based on the performance that they’re seeing at the installation. Here are the Control4 user interfaces that display camera streams:

- T4 Touch Screen
- T3 Touch Screen
- iOS application
- Android application
- On Screen Display (OSD)


### Codec

Control4 only supports h.264 over RTSP.


### Resolution

1280x720 is supported across all devices currently.


### Frame Rate

Frame rate and iFrame intervals will vary based on location and content. If the content is consistently changing, a low iframe interval is recommended as the iframe is updated more often. On Screen Display doesn’t support a high frame rate. It is important to understand that Frame Rate is dependent on both the Control4 system configuration and what the cameras are monitoring. Because of this, exact guidelines are difficult to provide. However, a base line configuration as shown below may provide a good starting point.
