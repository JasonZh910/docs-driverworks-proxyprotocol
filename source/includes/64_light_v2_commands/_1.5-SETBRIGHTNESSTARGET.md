## SET BRIGHTNESS TARGET

Used to set the target brightness of where the light is being requested to go. Parameters are determined by the enabling/disabling of the [supports\_target][1] capability. See below for more information.


### Signature

`SET_BRIGHTNESS_TARGET ()`

_If the supports\_target capability is enabled or color is used:_

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Float | LIGHT\_BRIGHTNESS\_TARGET. Value as defined from drivers Min and Max brightness capabilities as set by the driver. If the brightness resolution capability is set to 10, .5, .01, and so on, the proxy will ensure the value sent to the driver meets the resolution/step capability.  If no resolution is set, the value of 1 is used for stepping. | 
| UInt | Rate: Milliseconds for the ramp duration.  This is guaranteed to be between the Min and Max rate if the driver sets these.|
| Note: If a driver supports [On Modes][2], it should track the following parameters: LIGHT\_BRIGHTNESS\_TARGET\_PRESET\_ID - The ID of the preset to trigger.|


_If the supports\_target capability is disabled in instances such as pre- O.S. 3.3.0 for backward compatibility of older drivers:_

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
|Int| LEVEL : from 0-100.|
Int| TIME: Milliseconds for the ramp.|



### Returns

`None`


### Usage Note

If the capability supports\_target is not enabled (pre 3.3.0 for backward compatibility of older drivers) then the following parameters are sent to a driver.

- LEVEL - Integer - from 0-100
- TIME - Integer - Milliseconds for the ramp

If supports\_target or color is used (current  generation drivers) then the following parameters are sent to a driver.

- LIGHT\_BRIGHTNESS\_TARGET - Float - Value as defined from drivers Min and Max brightness capabilities as set by the driver. If the brightness resolution capability is set to 10, .5, .01, and so on, the proxy will ensure the value sent to the driver meets the resolution/step capability.  If no resolution is set, the value of 1 is used for stepping.

- RATE - Unit - Milliseconds for the ramp duration.  This is guaranteed to be between the Min and Max rate if the driver sets these.

If a driver supports On Modes, it should track the following parameters:

LIGHT\_BRIGHTNESS\_TARGET\_\PRESET\_ID - The ID of the preset to trigger.
