## SET BRIGHTNESS TARGET

Used to set the target brightness of where the light is being requested to go. 

All Lights have the following Presets at minimum and can be used by UI's, Voice Control, Programming, etc so a UI does not have to look up common Presets and/or levels for general control.

"On" - This is the Preset that should be used when turning a light on.  The level and rate that matches what a Top "Click" press would activate.  The Level was imported from the PRESET LEVEL value in previous OS releases.\_Â 
"Off" - This is the Preset that should be used when turning a light off.  This presets level and rate matches what the bottom 

"Click" on a physical device would be.

"Slow On" - This is the level and rate that matches what a Top button "Hold" press would be.

"Slow Off" - This is the level and rate that matches what a Bottom button "Hold" press would be.

Additional presets can be added via the C4TYPE PRESET API.  This will allow drivers that have common "20% 40% 60% 80%" presets to define these presets and the LightV2 proxy will automatically take care of creating keypad bindings and managing LED status tracking of those presets and keypad button status.

### Usage Note

Control4 is discouraging the use of the following commands as they will be deprecated. The SET BRIGHTNESS TARGET API should be used in their place:

ON: Use SET BRIGHTNESS TARGET with the param PRESET =  "On".

OFF: Use SET BRIGHTNESS TARGET with the param PRESET =  "Off".

SET LIGHT LEVEL: Use SET BRIGHTNESS TARGET with the param RATE of 0.

RAMP TO LEVEL: Use SET BRIGHTNESS TARGET with RATE in milliseconds.
