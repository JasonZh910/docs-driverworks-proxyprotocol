## SET\_COLOR\_TARGET

Sent to drivers to change the color. Once drivers begin to change color, they should send a COLOR\_CHANGING Notify. Then once the color has finished changing it should send a COLOR\_CHANGED Notify.


### Signature

`SET_COLOR_TARGET()`


| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `LIGHT_COLOR_TARGET_X` = X Coordinate of CIE 1931 Chromaticity Diagram |
| `LIGHT_COLOR_TARGET_Y` = Y Coordinate of CIE 1931 Chromaticity Diagram |
| `LIGHT_COLOR_TARGET_MODE` = Integer of: 0 full color, 1 color correlated temperature. Default is 0.  Most Bulb, LED strip and their drivers can likely ignore this. This is provided in the case that some bulbs or drivers need to track if they are in working in a cct mode or color mode. We recommend all drivers stick to only operating in full\_color mode if possible. |
| LIGHT\_COLOR\_TARGET\_RATE | Integer. Parameter of milliseconds to ramp over. Will use driver default if parameter is not used. |



### Returns

`None`


### Usage Note

If a driver implemented On Mode, the following parameters should be tracked:

LIGHT\_COLOR\_TARGET\_PRESET\_ID - The ID of the preset to trigger. This must be sent with the LIGHT\_COLOR\_TARGET\_PRESET\_ORIGIN parameter.

LIGHT\_COLOR\_TARGET\_PRESET\_ORIGIN - The origin of the preset to trigger.  1 = Device specific preset.   2 = Color Agent preset.
