# Introduction

Welcome to the DriverWorks Proxy and Protocol Guide. This guide defines all of the Proxies supported through DriverWorks SDK. You can use DriverWorks to write Control4 drivers that connect a Control4 system with third party devices or to extend the functionality of a Control4 system. All DriverWorks drivers are a combination of source code written in Lua and a configuration file written in XML.
