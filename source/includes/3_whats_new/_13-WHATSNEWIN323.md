## Whatâ€™s New in 3.2.3

**Audio Equalization available on Navigators**

The Amplifier and AV Switch Proxies have been enhanced to support the ability to display [audio EQ functions][1] on devices running Navigator. The enhancement includes a set of new Proxy Commands, Notifications and Capabilities to support this feature.



**Dynamic Transport Controls on Navigators**

AV drivers now have the ability to define which [transport controls][2] are displayed on Navigators. This includes which buttons appear on the Button Bar as well as the Media Dashboard. This enhancement allows for the appropriate transport controls being displayed for each AV device.
