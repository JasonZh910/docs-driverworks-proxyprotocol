## color\_trace\_tolerance

If converting to RGB or HSV color spaces it is worth noting that these two are not as accurate in resolution as the CIE xy chromaticity color space.

Because of this, there can be a loss of accuracy when converting to them or between them. For example, a Control4 Customer Interface sends the color's Hue and Saturation. If a device operates in RGB color spaces, the reported color might differ because of a rounding issue when converting between the RGB and HSV color space. This capability is used to add a tolerance when the Control4 system compares if two colors are equal.

The LightV2 proxy internally stores color as xy chromaticity. Two colors are treated equal if they are within Euclid distance specified by the color\_trace\_tolerance capability.

The following are pre-calculated tolerances for some of the mostly used color spaces. If the device uses one of the color spaces listed bellow to set and report color, use its tolerance as the capability:

RGB: 0.006
HSV 0.001
