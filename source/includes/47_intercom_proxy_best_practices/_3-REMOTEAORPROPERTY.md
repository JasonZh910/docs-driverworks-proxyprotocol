## Using the RemoteAor Property

When the “remoteAor” parameter is used in a notification or command, the value is always the address of record of the other intercom device participating in an intercom call. For example, consider that intercom device A has address of record of “sip-user-A@192.168.1.123” and intercom device B has an address of record of “sip-user-B@192.168.1.123”. Intercom device A initiates a call with intercom device B, which results in an `INCOMING_CALL` notification on intercom device B. When intercom device B issues the `ACCEPT_CALL` command, which takes remoteAor as a parameter, intercom device B should use “sip-user-A@192.168.1.123” (the address of record of intercom device A, or the initiator) as the value of this parameter. Likewise, when intercom device A receives the `CALL_ACCEPTED` notification, it will contain a remoteAor property that has the value of the address of record of intercom device B, or “sip-user-B@192.168.1.123”.
